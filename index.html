                        The salaries also depends on the size of the company as we all know bigger company offers higher salary.
                        However, according to the graph, it seems like medium size companies are offering much higher salary than 
                        larger size company for  <span style="color: orange"><span style="font-weight: bold">Data Science</span></span> related job.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This may due to the higher number of employees working on the same project, resulting in lesser share of salaries. The other cause 
                        might be due to COVID-19 which larger size companies might suffer more lose compare to medium size companies
